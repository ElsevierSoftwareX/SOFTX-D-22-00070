# SerialTrack MATLAB code package
ScalE and Rotation Invariant Augmented Lagrangian Particle Tracking

This repositry contains the Matlab m-files to run our SerialTrack particle tracking algorithm. This code package includes both 2D and 3D particle trackings to track their full-field 2D and 3D displacement fields, respectively. More details can be found in our SerialTrack paper (***Link to be updated***).

## Install and execute SerialTrack

### Code installation
To run SerialTrack, please download MATLAB version later than 2021a and install these code packages/toolboxes:
* Parallel computing toolbox
* Wavelets analysis toolbox
* Image processing toolbox

### Input Image Requirements
* 2D image sequences (at least two frames)
* 3D volumetric images (at least two volumetric stacks)

### Running included example case
1. Make sure that the main files and the supplemental m files (from file exchange) are added to the path in Matlab.
2. Download and save the [example data sets](***Datasets link to be updated***) in the "./imgFolder" folder. 
3. Run the example*.m files in the folder "./Example_main_files"
